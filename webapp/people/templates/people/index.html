        <p>
          Simon Gladman was one of the founding members of Galaxy Australia, and lead the technical design and development of the service. He unfortunately passed away in late 2022, leaving a gap in the team that may never be fully repaired. Simon was a brilliant engineer, and his passion for Galaxy, board games and D&D will be remembered by many in the global Galaxy community. Galaxy Australia is his legacy, and we are proud to continue his work.
