      The tools in this section have been divided into subsections to make it
      easier for users to find the tools they need. This must replace the
      entire value of the `content` key i.e. you can't mix
      subsections with standalone items.

      A workflow is a series of Galaxy tools that have been linked together
      to perform a specific analysis. You can use and customize the example workflows

          Yes. Galaxy Australia has assembly tools for small prokaryote genomes as well as larger eukaryote genomes.
          We are continually adding new tools and optimising them for large genome assemblies - this means adding enough computer processing power to run data-intensive tools, as well as configuring
          aspects such as parallelisation.


          **Please contact us if**
          - you need to increase your data storage limit
          - there is a tool you wish to request
          - a tool appears to be broken or running slowly
        title_md: Can I use Galaxy Australia to assemble a large genome?
      - description_md: >
          - See the tutorials in this Help section. They cover different approaches to genome assembly
          - Read the methods in scientific papers about genome assembly, particularly those about genomes with similar characteristics to those in your project
          - See the Workflows section for examples of different approaches to genome assembly - these cover different sequencing data types, and a variety of tools.
